I love programming because it's hard. There are an infinite number of ways to approach a problem and an infinite number of ways you can shoot yourself in the foot. The reason I wake up in the morning is to find new ways to manage that complexity and discover new solutions nobody has thought of before.

My current specialty is blockchain and cryptocurrency projects, whether that be creating tokens, smart contracts, project websites, or anything else you may need to make your project a success. I have worked with most popular frameworks, and can pick up any other platform out there. If you have a project you need help with, feel free to contact me through my website, and I will get back to you within two business days.

## Skills
- Fullstack Development
