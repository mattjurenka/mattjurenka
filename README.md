I love programming because it's hard. There are an infinite number of ways to approach a problem and an infinite number of ways you can shoot yourself in the foot. The reason I wake up in the morning is to find new ways to manage that complexity and discover new solutions nobody has thought of before.

I am currently working at Amazon and am looking to take on new clients for this coming fall. I have been programming for over 9 years now, starting as a hobbiest and moving into the professional world. I have worked with most popular frameworks, and can pick up any other platform out there. If you have a project you need help with, feel free to send me an email here, and I will get back to you within two business days.

## Skills
- Fullstack Development
- Blockchain Development
- TypeScript and Rust expert
- Have used or can learn very quickly all other popular languages/tech stacks (even prolog)
