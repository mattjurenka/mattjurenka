Jurenka Software is a full service software development agency that focuses on delivering quality results.

Though we are able to take on any project regardless of the technology involved, most of our recent engineering has been around Sui, Move, and Rust.

Our experience in big tech leads us to prioritize maintainability and testability, ensuring that software we write today will continue to work throughout the years.

## What We Offer

### Full Stack Development

We take on the whole software lifecycle, from the inception of the idea to it's final release. We can handle both frontend and backend, and use any technology, even if it falls outside of our specialty.

### Audits

Don't risk waking up to your protocol appearing on [the rekt leaderboard](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/). We can run an audit on a pay per vulnerability discovered basis, so you only pay for value added by our services.

### Training

Want to jump into the Sui ecosystem and learn Move? We offer tutoring sessions at a flat hourly rate. We can use the time to do anything from discussing the details of Sui consensus to architecting your next smart contract.
